## Detail

Specification date: 1st February 2024
Analyst: Simon Wickham
QA: Andy Wilson
Project: L00721a CMAST CYP Alliance

## Requirements

Analytics are supporting the delivery lead for the CMAST project through a review of attendances at Emergency Departments (ED) across the Cheshire and Mersey ICB. The system are experiencing a large volume of children and young people attending ED in relation to poor mental health. This is thought to have a knock on impact on admitted patient beds.

Investigations will be taken into the data for the ICB to identify any changes in ED attendances over recent years.

The data will be considered at an ICB level, and broken down at the trust and site level.
